With the way things are looking you might just be able to ride this situation out to extract more and more concessions from the party establishment who had also held you down. No, you can keep this going, squeeze them by the necks until they’re practically begging for you, Byrd, or Russell to be the nominee, and then only then will you come strutting back to McGrath and his cronies. With four years to go until then, you have plenty of time to wring the best deal possible. In the meantime you can be rest assured under Taft the NRA won’t pass, but still as a man with Civil Rights ideas you’ll need to keep your base ready for any sort of anti-lynching laws.

Kefauver himself a New Deal Southerner who may just be persuaded to hold off on any Civil Rights legislation in exchange for support both economically and for his idea of a Kefauver Committee meant to route out corruption. Or Dirksen, a major Republican conservative who aligns more with your own economic policies, yet has also expressed support for the NRA in many closed circles from what you can tell, but to roll back the New Deal he may be willing to shelve social progress.
