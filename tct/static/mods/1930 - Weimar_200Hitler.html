The world is now your oyster, and you immediately began refashioning it to your heart's desire.</p>
	  <p>The Allies, unsuspecting to face technological marvels centuries ahead of them, are crushed into paste, and the Swastika flies across the entire planet. Immediately, you go ahead with your master plan - a world without Jews, without Slavs, Romani, and other "undesirables", a system in which a small elite crushes the rest of humankind under a steel boot, a planet of pure misery and torture to all but yourself.</p>

	  <p>In a last act of desperation, you have been given a mecha suit, the finest technology that the entire industrial apparatus could produce, to face off against Blazkowicz in a final duel. It was not enough. Decades of Nazi tyranny are finally overthrown, and the flag of revolution waves in the blue sky, calling the oppressed mankind, the poor, huddled masses, to rally behind the New Colossus.</p>

A National Revolution will wash over Germany, whether you want it or not.</p>

A significant part of the Reichswehr chose to defect to your side, while Communist revolts broke out in the territory of the Republic, further dividing the anti-Nazi forces. An advantage in morale, control of key population centers, a united leadership behind the Nazi Party and a hefty amount of luck finally allowed you to prevail against the old elite. The SA was reorganized into a National Revolutionary Army and scored crucial victories near Potsdam and Bielefeld, which led to the final surrender of the Republican leadership. You have won.</p>
	  <p>The civil war was brutal, and vast pogroms took place throughout territories controlled by the SA during the conflict, which extended to a national scale afterwards. A revolutionary fascist regime was established in Berlin, declaring a Third Reich, nationalizing major industries, sentencing hundreds of thousands to prison labor to rebuild Germany’s destroyed infrastructure. Yet, it is no longer truly your Reich. During the war, you were turned into a puppet of the SA, and while you may still have some influence over domestic policy - the extermination of the Jewish population was pushed forth by you specifically - you now have to listen to the wishes of Ernst Röhm...</p>

Sensing Germany’s weakness, the Western Allies will stand against you in Czechoslovakia and the Czechs will choose to resist - which will be Röhm’s army’s undoing. Its elan is worthless against field fortifications and artillery, and the loss of experience during the purges will lead to a complete military breakdown.</p>

Ludwig Beck, the man who you and Röhm thought was trustworthy, who had defended the three Nazi officers in the 1930 trial and defected to the National Revolutionary Army, will be the leader of this conspiracy. You will be executed in early 1939 and thrown to an unmarked grave, while a military dictatorship that will last until the 1970s will be established in Germany. Discredited, National Socialism will die with you, at least for several decades.</p>

		  <p>The real winner of the 1930 elections was Heinrich Brüning - strong showings for Zentrum and for the DNVP, which was willing to back him in certain instances, allowed him to whip the large mass of minor parties in the Reichstag to shape and achieve a strong plurality for the cabinet - at last, though it appeared impossible, a 'Bürgerblock' was achieved. Easier breathing room in the Reichstag allowed Brüning to push through a federal ban of the disintegrating SA, crack down on the Roter Frontk\u00e4mpferbund, and pursue full reform of the economy. Unemployment rose, massively, and the fury of the people grew, but without an outlet, the frustrated masses could easily be suppressed by the Reichswehr.</p>
		  <p>Hindenburg's retirement in 1932 allowed the Bürgerblock to push forth a unity candidate - Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, KVP member of the Reichstag and hero of the Great War, whose name recognition and a divided opposition easily handed him the victory. Germany's transformation was complete. A true 'authoritarian democracy', ruled not by demagogues of the streets, but technocrats and experts who know what the common man truly needs and wants.</p>

		  <p>The winner of the 1930 elections was the SPD - it washed away the stain of the fall of the Grand Coalition and proved that the machinations of Hindenburg, Brüning and Schleicher were against the will of the people. Its representation in the Reichstag was enormous, and turned it into a heavyweight that Brüning had to constantly keep in mind as he pushed for his deflationary agenda. Elected on an agenda of opposing Brüning, the SPD neutered his authoritarian dreams, defeating one Presidential decree after another and pushing tensions between the President, the Cabinet and the Reichstag to the brink.</p>
		  <p>Until, the presidential elections of 1932 arrived. Against the wishes of Brüning and Schleicher, who feared that a SPD-backed candidate will win without the old marshal in the race, Hindenburg chose to retire, leaving the field open. Yet, the SPD did not make the predictable move of fielding Otto Braun or Paul Löbe - instead, they chose to collaborate with Hindenburg's circle. Ultimately, liberal politician Otto Gessler was advanced as a candidate of national unity and won handily. Though Schleicher remained influential, Gessler was his own man, working with the Reichstag instead of relying on decrees. By 1934, the economy began to recover, and the German Republic, though weaker than before, continued to the thirties as a democracy...</p>

Not only that, but your decision to cooperate more thoroughly with Hugenberg's party from here on out was another major boon for the Nationals - with you and your speaking talents by their side, the DNVP could found the Harzburg Front, a lasting alliance of the National Opposition against Brüning and the left. By 1932, the declining economic situation drew more and more desperate voters to the Nationalist camp, bringing the nation on the verge of open conflict.</p>
		  <p>In 1932, Hindenburg chose to not seek a second term, and the unified nationalist camp ultimately forwarded a joint candidate - none other than Crown Prince Wilhelm. It was hardly an easy task - not only did the prince have to defeat the frustration of his father, but Hugenberg, who did not truly desire a monarchist restoration and merely looked for himself, had to be dissuaded from running for the Presidency himself. Defeating weak candidates from the left and centre, the Crown Prince was elected President and immediately formed a restorationist cabinet, tasked to reestablish the German Empire.

A few months later, you will pass away and receive a humble grave.
