As every Parish lost more and more autonomy, the state became one of two capitals: Fort Liberty and Raceland. Taking his newfound power-sharing agreement between his two home parishes, Languedoc effectively became a revolutionary dictator, one that would take on the entire Big Easy at once and - somehow - unify all of greater Louisiana itself, from Texas City to Biloxi. This new empire would ravage the rest of the American continent in a near-unstoppable massacre. All of this cost dearly, however; the Free Yefferson Church was banned and Neo-Baptism became the state religion; the democracy which once stood proud as one of few in the South became nothing more than a approval referendum which was thoroughly rigged; and last but not least, the very Plaquemine Culture he helped develop was wiped clean of its history.
